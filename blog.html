<p>Here&#8217;s a blog of things I&#8217;ve found interesting in computer science. I&#8217;ve tried to write this blog as if it were for my younger undergraduate self, perhaps some time between first arriving at university and the end of second year. That&#8217;s just a rough guide, though! Hopefully some of it is interesting.</p>

<p>I've been reading up around B&uuml;chi automata (BAs) recently, as well as their cousins (Muller, Rabin, Streett and parity automata, amongst others), and have been wondering what similar automata exist that may or may not be equivalent to B&uuml;chi automata. So here's a catalogue of some automata I've thought up as of late.

<p>When doing mathematics, you might wonder what it is that makes mathematical statements true. It's true that $2 + 2 = 4$, sure, but what makes it true is unclear. Ask a mathematician, and they may heartily tell you that it follows from the axioms. But, if that's the case, what is it that makes the axioms true?
